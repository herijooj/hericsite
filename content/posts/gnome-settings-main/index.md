In this post i will try to explain my setup and ramble about gnome devs and this DE

# The Idea:

Just a Screen. Simple as that.

![](./scr/setup1.png)

I call all my programs through shortcuts. I use the overview sometimes to switch workspaces or to see the time/date, I think it works pretty great.

## Themes

I just use the normal adwaita theme. To be honest I kinda like the old one more, with all the depth and that kinda-like skeuomorphic design. It was "modern" but not taste-less like GTK4.

To make everthing consistent i installed [Adw-GTK3](https://github.com/lassekongo83/adw-gtk3), it makes the GTK3 programs look like GTK4 ones.

## Icons

I gave up trying to customize stuff, i just use [MoreWaita](https://github.com/somepaulo/MoreWaita) now, i think it looks cute.

# Extensions

![Extensions screenshot](./scr/extensions.png)

1. [Auto Activities](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5500/auto-activities/)

This is kinda useless, but i like it. it opens the overview when there is no programs open.

1. [Caffeine](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/)

I use this to disable the screensaver when i am doing something where i don't touch the mouse for a long time. It also disables the screensaver when i am in fullscreen.

1. [Custom Accent Colors](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5547/custom-accent-colors/)

I don't like much color, so i made everything gray.

1. [GSConnect](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/1319/gsconnect/)

This is incredible, it works so well. I can have notifications, sync the clipboard, mute the computer when i get a call, control the music, send files and etc. I use it with KDEConnect on my phone.

1. [GTK3 Theme Switcher](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5401/gtk3-theme-switcher/)

So when the night-theme kicks in, the GTK3 programs also change to the dark theme.

1. [Just Perfection](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/3843/just-perfection/)

This has everthing, i use to only show the top bar in the overview, make the dock slighly smaller and some other stuff.

1. [No Titlebar When Maximized](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/4630/no-titlebar-when-maximized/)

I use shortcuts to close, minimize and maximize programs, the titlebar is useless in programs like vscode.

1. [Rounded Window Corners](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/5237/rounded-window-corners/)

So that every window looks cute.

# Extras

## Firefox Gnome Theme

There is a theme for firefox that makes it look like Gnome Web, it's called [Firefox Gnome Theme](https://github.com/rafaelmardojai/firefox-gnome-theme), it also hides the tabs when there is only one open.

# Final Thoughts

I am happy with my setup. I Hate gnome so much you have no idea, but I guess I got used to it? I like the overview and a bit of the design. I tried KDE for about 20 minutes and gave up. Maybe someday I will be happy with a riced i3 setup again but i don't want to configure it.
